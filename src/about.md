## Reclaiming scientific discourse, one conversation at a time.

Open Science Network emerged from a simple but powerful observation: when scientists depend on corporate platforms for critical discourse, they become vulnerable to the whims of billionaires and shareholder profits. The collapse of "ScienceTwitter" scattered years of valuable scientific conversations across fragmented platforms, revealing how thoroughly our community had become dependent on infrastructure we neither owned nor controlled.

## Built by Scientists, for Scientists

We believe scientific discourse deserves better. Open Science Network is **co-designed with researchers, scientific communities, and open science advocates** who understand that the infrastructures of scientific communication shape science itself. When platforms optimize for engagement over accuracy, they fundamentally cannot host trustworthy scientific discourse.

Our solution is different: **federated digital spaces where researchers and their institutions maintain complete control** over their conversations, data, and collaborations. Universities can host their own instances while connecting to a global network of scientific communities. Discussions become citable FAIR objects with DOIs. Publications come alive with rich metadata and collaborative annotations.

## Community-Governed, Open by Design

Open Science Network operates without venture capital or private funding. We're building infrastructure that **serves science instead of extracting value from it**. Every line of code is open source. Every decision involves the research community. Every feature addresses real needs identified through ongoing collaboration with scientists worldwide.


## The Future of Scientific Communication

We envision a world where scientific conversations transcend institutional walls without sacrificing institutional sovereignty. Where valuable research insights are preserved as permanent, citable parts of the scholarly record. Where a physicist at MIT can seamlessly collaborate with a climate scientist at ETH Zurich, each using their institution's platform while connecting to the broader open social web.

This isn't just about building better toolsâ€”it's about **building the infrastructure that science deserves**. Infrastructure owned by researchers, governed by communities, and designed to amplify human knowledge rather than corporate profits.

**Join us in reclaiming scientific discourse.** The future of research communication should be in the hands of researchers themselves.
