  <div class="collapse-title font-semibold text-xl">How do social discussions become part of the scholarly record?</div>
  <div class="collapse-content prose max-w-none">
    <p>Researchers can transform any post or discussion into a citable scholarly publication with just a few clicks. The
      process currently integrates with Zenodo and InvenioRDM to generate DOIs, archive the content, and create structured
      metadata
      records that meet scholarly publishing standards.</p>
    <p>When archiving a post, researchers can:
    <ul>
      <li>Add formal metadata (title, abstract, keywords, license)</li>
      <li>Include or exclude replies or comments</li>
      <li>Add co-authors (prepopulated from discussion participants if including comments)</li>
      <li>Set visibility and access permissions</li>
      <li>Choose the publication type and categorization</li>
      </ul>
    If your OSN instance has access to the ORCID members API, publications are automatically added to your ORCID
    profile, and co-authors receive notifications with instructions for claiming authorship and linking their ORCID
    profiles.<br />
    This process bridges the gap between informal scientific discourse and formal scholarly communication, making valuable
    research conversations part of the permanent academic record.</p>

      <div class="collapse-title font-semibold text-xl">How does OSN support our open science mandate or policy?
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content prose max-w-none">
        <p>The Open Science Network enables institutions to meet global open science requirements by design. When
          researchers
          archive discussions as DOI-certified publications, they automatically create FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
          Interoperable, Reusable) research outputs that comply with most institutional and funder mandates.</p>
        <p>The platform supports flexible visibility controls - researchers can keep discussions private during early
          research
          stages and make them publicly accessible when ready. This "as open as possible, as closed as necessary" approach
          adapts to
          diverse policy requirements while respecting researchers' workflow needs.</p>
        <p>For institutions with open science mandates, OSN transforms routine scientific conversations into compliant
          research
          outputs without adding bureaucratic overhead, and seamlessly integrates them into the scholarly record.</p>

          <div class="collapse-title font-semibold text-xl">Can researchers collaborate with scientists at other institutions?
          </div>
          <div class="collapse-content prose max-w-none">
            <p>Yes, the Open Science Network is built on the open social web, enabling seamless collaboration across
              institutional boundaries while maintaining local data sovereignty. Researchers can follow and interact with colleagues
              on other OSN instances, as well as Mastodon, Bluesky, Bonfire and other federated platforms.</p>
            <p>This means a publication created on your OSN instance can include contributions from researchers at universities
              worldwide, even if they're using different platforms. The federated architecture ensures that global collaboration
              doesn't require surrendering control of your community's data or governance policies.</p>
            <p>Each institution maintains complete autonomy over their community while participating in the broader scientific
              social web, reconciling data sovereignty with global reach.</p>

                <p>
                  OSN is designed for integration, not replacement. We can create adapters and connectors for existing research
                  infrastructure including repository services, institutional authentication systems, and publication databases.
                <p>
                  The platform already integrates with ORCID for researcher identity and automatic publication history import, OpenAlex
                  for research metadata enrichment, and Zenodo/InvenioRDM for data sharing and preservation.

  <div class="collapse-title font-semibold text-xl">How does this handle research data beyond publications?</div>
  <div class="collapse-content prose max-w-none">
    <p>OSN integrates with research repositories to link conversations directly to relevant datasets, code, and
      supplementary materials. When researchers share papers, the system automatically enriches them with metadata from
      multiple sources: co-authors, journal information, open access links, and connections to related datasets or
      software.
      <p>
      Through OpenAlex integration, researcher profiles are automatically enriched using their ORCID ID to
      pull comprehensive research data. This includes widgets displaying their most recent publications, research
      topics, institutional affiliations and more, all without manual data entry. The system creates dynamic research
      profiles that stay current as researchers publish new work.
      <p>
        This creates a comprehensive research environment where discussions, data, publications, and researcher expertise
        form an interconnected web of knowledge, all while maintaining institutional control over your community's
        intellectual assets.
