          <div class="collapse-title font-semibold text-xl">How does this support our open science mandate/policy compliance?</div>
          <div class="collapse-content prose max-w-none">
            <p>The Open Science Network enables institutions to meet global open science requirements by design. When researchers archive discussions as DOI-certified publications, they automatically create FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) research outputs that comply with most institutional and funder mandates.</p>

            <p>The platform supports flexible visibility controls - researchers can keep discussions private during development, then make them publicly accessible when ready. This "as open as possible, as closed as necessary" approach meets diverse policy requirements while respecting researchers' workflow needs.</p>

            <p>For institutions with open science mandates, OSN transforms routine scientific conversations into compliant research outputs without adding bureaucratic overhead. Your discussions become part of the scholarly record naturally, not through forced additional steps.</p>

          <div class="collapse-title font-semibold text-xl">Can researchers collaborate with scientists at other institutions seamlessly?</div>
          <div class="collapse-content prose max-w-none">
            <p>Yes, the Open Science Network is built on the federated social web, enabling seamless collaboration across institutional boundaries while maintaining local data sovereignty. Researchers can follow and interact with colleagues on other OSN instances, Mastodon, Bluesky, Bonfire and other federated platforms.</p>
            <p>This means a publication created on your OSN instance can include contributions from researchers at universities worldwide, even if they're using different platforms. The federated architecture ensures that global collaboration doesn't require surrendering control of your community's data or governance policies.</p>
            <p>Each institution maintains complete autonomy over their community while participating in the broader scientific social web, combining data ownership with global reach.</p>

        <div class="collapse collapse-arrow bg-base-100 border border-base-content/30">
          <input type="radio" name="my-accordion-2" />
          <div class="collapse-title font-semibold text-xl">How do social discussions become part of the scholarly record?</div>
          <div class="collapse-content prose max-w-none">
            <p>Researchers can transform any discussion into a citable scholarly publication with just a few clicks. The archiving process currently integrates with Zenodo and InvenioRDM to generate DOIs and create structured metadata records that meet scholarly publishing standards.</p>

            <p>When archiving a post, researchers can:
                <ul>
                    <li>Add formal metadata (title, abstract, keywords, license)</li>
                    <li>Include or exclude replies and comments</li>
                    <li>Add co-authors from discussion participants</li>
                    <li>Set visibility and access permissions</li>
                    <li>Choose the publication type and categorization</li>
                </ul>
                If your OSN instance has ORCID Members API integration enabled, publications are automatically added to their ORCID profiles. Co-authors receive notifications with instructions for claiming authorship and linking their ORCID profiles.<br/>
                This process bridges the gap between informal scientific discourse and formal scholarly communication, making valuable research conversations part of the permanent academic record.</p>

            <div class="collapse-content prose max-w-none">
                <p>Yes, researchers have full control over their published content. They can update metadata for existing publications or create new versions that automatically link to previous iterations, maintaining complete publication history and citation integrity.</p>

            <div class="collapse-content prose max-w-none">
                <p>No. There are no annual licensing fees, per-seat pricing, usage limits, or vendor lock-in mechanisms. The AGPL license ensures the software remains free forever.<br/>
Our business model focuses on optional services (hosting, custom development, training) rather than mandatory fees. You can always export your data, modify the software, or migrate to different hosting without restrictions.</p>

            <div class="collapse-title font-semibold text-xl">How is the Open Science Network sustainable?</div>
            <div class="collapse-content prose max-w-none">
                <p>OSN sustainability comes from multiple aligned sources:
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Grant funding</b>: Research and development grants for open science infrastructure</li>
                    <li><b>Donations</b>: Community and institutional support for the public good</li>
                    <li><b>Optional services</b>: Managed hosting, custom development, and training programs</li>
                    <li><b>Institutional partnerships</b>: Collaborative development with research organizations</li>
                    </ul>
                <br/>
                Our sustainability model ensures long-term sustainability without compromising the open-source nature or creating vendor dependencies. The community-owned approach means development priorities align with researcher needs, not shareholder demands.</p>

            <div class="collapse-content prose max-w-none">
                <p>OSN is built on Bonfire, a modular framework for federated social networks. The initiative is led by the Bonfire core team in collaboration with scientists and researchers, ensuring development stays focused on actual research community needs.<br/>
                The modular architecture allows communities to add features as they evolve, from repository connectors to peer review workflows, without vendor dependencies.</p>

            <div class="collapse-content prose max-w-none">
                <p>Yes, OSN uses ActivityPub federation to connect with the broader scientific social web. Researchers can follow and interact with colleagues on Mastodon, other Bonfire instances, and ActivityPub-compatible platforms.
                    <br/>
                OSN also includes bridge systems for Bluesky compatibility, allowing interaction with researchers across different platforms. Publications can include contributions from users on various platforms, enabling true cross-platform scientific collaboration.</p>

            <div class="collapse-content prose max-w-none">
                <p>OSN integrates with research repositories to link conversations directly to relevant datasets, code, and supplementary materials. When researchers share papers, the system automatically enriches them with metadata from multiple sources: co-authors, journal information, open access links, and connections to related datasets or software.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Through <b>OpenAlex API</b> integration, researcher profiles are automatically enriched using their ORCID ID to pull comprehensive research data. This includes widgets displaying their most recent publications, research topics, institutional affiliations and more, all without manual data entry. The system creates dynamic research profiles that stay current as researchers publish new work.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    This creates a comprehensive research environment where discussions, data, publications, and researcher expertise form an interconnected web of knowledge, all while maintaining institutional control over your community's intellectual assets.</p>

                <p>
                    OSN is designed for integration, not replacement. We create adapters and connectors for existing research infrastructure including repository services, institutional authentication systems, and publication databases.
<br/>
<br/>
                    The platform integrates with ORCID for researcher identity and with OpenAlex for automatic publication history import. When researchers sign in through institutional Single Sign-On, their research profiles appear immediately with publications, affiliations, and interests automatically populated.
